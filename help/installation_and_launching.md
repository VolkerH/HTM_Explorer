## HTM Explorer: installation and starting ##


### Installation of R ###

you need an R version > 3.0

do not use R Studio!

[R on the web](http://www.r-project.org/)

make sure the Tcl/Tk libraries are part of the installation package; normally this is the case by default.


### Installation of R packages ###

Start R; within the R console window type:

`install.packages("gWidgets")`

`install.packages("gWidgetstcltk")`

`install.packages("markdown")`

Note: if you are using Windows 7 it may ask you whether it should install it as "personal libraries"...just say "yes"


### Installation of the HTM Explorer ###

Simply copy all the files somewhere onto your computer; you can download the files from [github](
https://github.com/tischi/HTM_Explorer/archive/master.zip).


### Starting the HTM Explorer ###

Start R and type below commands replacing `/path/to/` by the location of the HTM folder:

`setwd("/path/to/HTM"); source("install.R");`

Now you see the graphical user interface popping up and you are ready to go.
