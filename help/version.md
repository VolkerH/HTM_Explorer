- fixed a bug where the wrong images would open in Fiji when clicking in ScatterPlot or JitterPlot; only occurred if the option to "show data points that did not pass QC" was not(!) selected and there actually were data points that did not pass QC; basically the indexing got messed up because the data points that did not pass QC were missing.
